 * Pluggable ID/IDREF handling layer.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>THIS INTERFACE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.</b>
 *
 * <p>
 * This 'interface' can be implemented by applications and specified to
 * {@link Unmarshaller#setProperty(String, Object)} to ovierride the ID/IDREF
 * processing of the JAXB RI like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * unmarshaller.setProperty(IDResolver.class.getName(),new MyIDResolverImpl());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Error Handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * This component runs inside the JAXB RI unmarshaller. Therefore, it needs
 * to coordinate with the JAXB RI unmarshaller when it comes to reporting
 * errors. This makes sure that applications see consistent error handling behaviors.
 *
 * <p>
 * When the {@link #startDocument(ValidationEventHandler)} method is invoked,
 * the unmarshaller passes in a {@link ValidationEventHandler} that can be used
 * by this component to report any errors encountered during the ID/IDREF processing.
 *
 * <p>
 * When an error is detected, the error should be first reported to this
 * {@link ValidationEventHandler}. If the error is fatal or the event handler
 * decided to abort, the implementation should throw a {@link SAXException}.
 * This signals the unmarshaller to abort the processing.
