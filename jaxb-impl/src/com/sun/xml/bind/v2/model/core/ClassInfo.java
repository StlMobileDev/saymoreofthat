/**
 * Information about JAXB-bound class.

 * <p>
 * All the JAXB annotations are already reflected to the model so that

 *
 * <h2>XML representation</h2>
 * <p>
 * A JAXB-bound class always have at least one representation
 * (called "type representation"),but it can optionally have another
 * representation ("element representation").
 *
 * <p>
 * In the type representaion, a class
 * is represented as a set of attributes and (elements or values).
 * You can inspect the details of those attributes/elements/values by {@link #getProperties()}.
 * This representation corresponds to a complex/simple type in XML Schema.
 * You can obtain the schema type name by {@link #getTypeName()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * If a class has an element representation, {@link #isElement()} returns true.
 * This representation is mostly similar to the type representation
 * except that the whoe attributes/elements/values are wrapped into
 * one element. You can obtain the name of this element through {@link #asElement()}.
