/**
 * Walks the XML document structure.
 *
 * Implemented by the unmarshaller and called by the API-specific connectors.
 *
 * <h2>Event Call Sequence</h2>
 *
 * The {@link XmlVisitor} expects the event callbacks in the following order:
 * <pre>
 * CALL SEQUENCE := startDocument ELEMENT endDocument
 * ELEMENT       := startPrefixMapping ELEMENT endPrefixMapping
 *               |  startElement BODY endElement
 * BODY          := text? (ELEMENT text?)*
 * </pre>
 * Note in particular that text events may not be called in a row;
 * consecutive characters (even those separated by PIs and comments)
 * must be reported as one event, unlike SAX.
 *
 * <p>
 * All namespace URIs, local names, and prefixes of element and attribute
 * names must be interned. qnames need not be interned.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Typed PCDATA</h2>
 * For efficiency, JAXB RI defines a few {@link CharSequence} implementations
 * that can be used as a parameter to the {@link #text(CharSequence)} method.
 * For example, see {@link Base64Data}.
 *
 * <h2>Error Handling</h2>
 * The visitor may throw {@link SAXException} to abort the unmarshalling process
 * in the middle.
