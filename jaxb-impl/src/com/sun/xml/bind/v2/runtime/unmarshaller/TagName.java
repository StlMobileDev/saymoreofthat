/**
 * Represents an XML tag name (and attributes for start tags.)

 * This object is used so reduce the number of method call parameters
 * among unmarshallers.
 *
 * An instance of this is expected to be reused by the caller of
 * {@link XmlVisitor}. Note that the rest of the unmarshaller may
 * modify any of the fields while processing an event (such as to
 * intern strings, replace attributes),
 * so {@link XmlVisitor} should reset all fields for each use.
 *
 * <p>
 * The 'qname' parameter, which holds the qualified name of the tag
 * (such as 'foo:bar' or 'zot'), is not used in the typical unmarshalling
 * route and it's also expensive to compute for some input.
 * Thus this parameter is computed lazily.
