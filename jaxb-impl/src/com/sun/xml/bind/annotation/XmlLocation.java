/**
 * Marks a property that receives a location from which the object is unmarshalled.
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * The @XmlLocation can be specified on:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>a field whose type is {@link Locator}, or
 *  <li>a method that takes a {@link Locator} as the sole parameter
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * When a class that contains such a field/method is unmarshalled by the JAXB RI,
 * such a field/method will receive an immutable {@link Locator} object that describes
 * the location in the XML document where the object is unmarshalled from.
 *
 * <p>
 * If the unmarshaller does not know the source location information, the locator
 * will not be set. For example, this happens when it is unmarshalling from a DOM tree.
 * This also happens if you use JAXB implementations other than the JAXB RI.
 *
 * <p>
 * This information can be used by applications, for example to provide user-friendly
 * error information.
